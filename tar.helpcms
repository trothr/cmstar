¢|where:¢%

¢|command¢%  is one of "c", "x", or "t", optionally with "v"
           and "f", "s", or 0..7, signifying:

           c : create a new archive
           x : extract files from an archive
           t : list the files in an archive
           ("c", "x", and "t" are mutually exclusive)

           v : verbose

           f : next argument is a disk resident archive
           s : next argument is a spool file or remote recipient
           01234567 : tape drive number, default is TAP1 (181)
           ("f", "s", and numerics are mutually exclusive)

¢|compressors¢%  is one of "Z", "z", "j", or "J"

 Note: compressors are external to CMS TAR.

¢|tarfile¢% is the filename of the disk resident archive, having a filetype
           of TAR, if F was specified in the command. This can also be the
           spoolid of the file when extracting a spool TAR file, or a target
           user@node when creating a spool TAR file.

           The recommended filetype is "TAR".
           You can override the filetype using Unix/Linux/Windows style
           filename.filetype notation, for example:

                tar tf thefile.cmstar

¢|pattern¢%  specifies what files to tar/untar.

           CREATING AN ARCHIVE
           When creating an archive, this pattern must be specified
           in the form 'fn ft fm', like when using the LISTFILE command.
           In addition to '*' and '%', periods (.) can be used as wilcards
           (like in Unix) so that if you specify simply '.' as the pattern,
           then all files on your 'A' disk will be archived. (curr directory)
           If the pattern omitted, only files specified with the INCLUDE option
           will be archived.

           EXTRACTING AN ARCHIVE
           If you want to extract only one file,  put it's name (exactly as it
           appears with the LIST command) here. If this option is omitted,
           all files will be extracted from the archive.

¢|Options:¢%

¢|INCLUDE fn
           specifies a FILELIST file listing files to be included in an
           archive being built. When creating an archive using an INCLUDE file,
           the name of each file as it will appear in the archive may follow
           fn ft fm in the FILELIST, overriding the standard "fn.ft"
           concatenation.

           The filetype of an include file is FILELIST and cannot be changed.
